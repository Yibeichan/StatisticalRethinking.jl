## Purpose of this package

This package contains Julia versions of "common components" contained in the R package "rethinking" associated with the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath.

Common components are those functions that do not depend on the chosen mcmc package.

## Github organization

StatisticalRethinking.jl is part of the broader [StatisticalRethinkingJulia](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia) Github organization.

Implementations of the models using Stan can be found in [StatisticalRethinkingStan](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl).

The intention is to over time also provide StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl and StatisticalRethinkingDhmc.jl.
